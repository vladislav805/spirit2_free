### This is fork!

This is fork of mikereidis/spirit2_free by Vladislav Veluga. Unfortunately, the author of this application died in 2016 and developed more than anyone else was engaged all this time. This application is one of a kind, there are no alternatives to it. Therefore, I would like to continue my colleague's work on the Open Source community and make the application better. At least I'll try.

Hello from currently cold and snowy Canada, :)

See the build_spirit2_free bash script to build from Linux. Edit the first few lines for your environment.

Besides the Android ant build for the Java code, the Android NDK is needed. I'm using android-ndk-r10, the r10b release gave me some problems so I reverted.

Please forgive all the usual transgressions; this code, like all real world code, has plenty of flaws and "character".

Be thankful it's not the steaming pile that Spirit1 became, originating when I first learned Java, and suffering from almost 4 years
of rapid development, and a maze of exceptions for handling hundreds of phones, ROMs, android versions, etc, etc, LOL.

Real life coding, trying to solve real problems of people, often requires compromise, and hasty and messy coding is one such.

I've been developing, and building electronics and computer equipment since I became a teen in the mid 1970's, on the first microprocessors, before even assemblers,
hacking "machine language" in binary, hex, or even octal on the front panel switches of the PDP-11/05 I built a Unibus display peripheral for....


Anyway, I haven't really done any open source before. At this time I'm just dumping the code, or "throwing it over the wall", as Google is said to do with AOSP.

So I'm not going to setup on Git or whatever immediately, since I'm not experienced with it much. We will see....

Feel free to share any thoughs to mikereidis@gmail.com or in my "Spirit FM" XDA forum: http://forum.xda-developers.com/apps/spirit-fm


Spirit is my full time job, but I'm sorry to say I still make less than half of my corporate salaries, and work about twice the hours, for the last almost 4 years, from early 2011.

I appreciate the financial support of people buying my apps, Spirit2: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=fm.a2d.s2  and the older Spirit1: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mikersmicros.fm_unlock

I am also happy to accept Paypal "donations" to my mikereidis@gmail.com address : https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_donations&business=mikereidis%40gmail%2ecom&lc=CA&item_name=Spirit%20FM%20%2d%20Mike%20Reid&currency_code=USD&bn=PP%2dDonationsBF%3abtn_donateCC_LG%2egif%3aNonHosted

The commercial Spirit2 has many features that are not in this Spirit2 Free app. As time goes by, I may move paid features to the Free version. The closer I can get to a "normal" salary, the more willing I will be to do so.


Thanks ! :)
Mike Reid.
